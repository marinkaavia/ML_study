Lesson 1 
Lost function - function to evaluate performance for 1 object only
A quality function for a machine learning model is a metric or a set of metrics used to evaluate the performance and effectiveness of the model, in simple words -it is summarized result of model performance based on lost function for 1 object
Example of evaluation metrics:
For regression usually use
MSE - mean squared error
MAE - mean absolute error
R2 -  R-Squared 

R2:
tells us the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variable(s). An R-Squared of 100% indicates that all changes in the dependent variable are completely explained by changes in the independent variable(s)
